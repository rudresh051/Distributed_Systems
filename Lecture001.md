# What is Distributed systems
> The core of it is a set of cooperating computers that are communicating with each other over network to get some coherent task done.
> Focus - Storage, big data computations(map reduce), peer to peer file sharing
> Critical infrastructure - are built on distributed systems

## Why people build this stuff?

* They need to get high performance(**parallelism**)
* To be able to tolerate fault(**Fault tolerance**)
* Physical reasons(Interbank transfers - Bank A in New york and another in London. )
  * > Systems that are inherently physically distributed
* Security/Isolated
  * > e.g. some code you don't trust and you want to talk to each other through Narrowly defined computer network protocol
  * > So it can be achieved by splitting things up into multiple computers so that can be isolated

Question - What makes distributed systems hard? 
## Challenges
* Concurrency
* Partial failure
* Performance
  * It takes careful design to make the system actually give you the performance you feel you deserve
